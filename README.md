# Movie-Searcher

Aron K Joseph
This is a project where the user will be able to see popular movies recommended to them, search movies, and favorite movies.
The project dynamically renders a grid of movies that most closely reflect the current state of the search query regardless of wheter it is submitted or not.
This project will use React js and The Movie Database for a database.
